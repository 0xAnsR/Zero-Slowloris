# ZeroSlowloris

## Introduction

ZeroSlowloris is a powerful Denial-of-Service (DoS) tool written in C++, inspired by the popular Python Slowloris tool. It introduces multithreading and customization options, making it a more efficient and versatile tool for conducting DoS attacks.

## Features

* **Multithreading:** ZeroSlowloris utilizes multiple threads to establish connections, significantly improving the speed and efficiency of the attack.
* **Customization:** With ZeroSlowloris, you have control over various parameters to tailor the attack according to your needs:
    * **Target:** The IP address or hostname of the target.
    * **Port:** The target port number.
    * **Max_socks:** The maximum number of sockets to open.
    * **Threads:** The number of threads to use.
    * **Min_delay:** [Optional] The minimum delay between each character (default:5ms).
    * **Max_delay:** [Optional] The maximum delay between each character (default:10ms).
    * **Delay_keep_alive:** [Optional] The delay between sending Keep-Alive headers (default:1 second).
    * **Delay_print_details:** [Optional] The delay for printing attack details (default:10 seconds).
* **Random User-Agent:** Each request sent by ZeroSlowloris includes a randomly generated User-Agent header, making it more challenging to detect and mitigate the attack.
* **Proxies (Coming Soon):** In future updates, ZeroSlowloris will include a proxy feature, allowing you to use multiple proxies simultaneously, further enhancing anonymity and making detection even harder.

## Usage

To use ZeroSlowloris, follow the instructions below:

```bash
Usage: Slowloris target port max_socks threads [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            Show help message and exit

Input Information:
  target        : The target IP address or hostname
  port          : The target port number
  max_socks     : The maximum number of sockets to open
  threads       : The number of threads to use
  min_delay     : [Optional] The minimum delay between each character (default:5ms)
  max_delay     : [Optional] The maximum delay between each character (default:10ms)
  delay_keep_alive : [Optional] The delay between sending Keep-Alive headers (default:1 second)
  delay_print_details : [Optional] The delay for printing attack details (default:10 seconds)

## Performance Comparison

We have conducted performance tests comparing ZeroSlowloris with the original Python Slowloris tool. The results were impressive:

* **Python Slowloris Tool:** It took approximately 5 minutes to establish 800 connections to the target.
* **ZeroSlowloris:** With its multithreading capabilities, ZeroSlowloris achieved the same result in just 16 seconds.
